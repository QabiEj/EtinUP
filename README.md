The Role of NLP in transforming customer service: A literature review
Abstract
Natural Language Processing (NLP) has revolutionized customer service by enhancing the efficiency, trust, and satisfaction levels of users through automation and personalized interactions. This systematic literature review evaluates the role of NLP in transforming customer service, particularly focusing on the integration of chatbots and automated systems. Using the PRISMA methodology, 23 studies from reputable sources were reviewed to analyze open-source tools, user experiences, ethical considerations, and future directions. The findings highlight advancements in sentiment analysis, adaptive learning models, and conversational strategies that mitigate service failures. However, challenges such as trust, empathy, and computational resource constraints persist. The review concludes by presenting actionable insights for improving NLP technologies to achieve a more empathetic and efficient customer service framework.
Introduction
Customer service has evolved beyond basic transactional interactions, becoming a key driver for customer retention, satisfaction, and brand differentiation. With the rapid rise of the digital economy, organizations seek advanced methods to handle increased consumer demands and complex inquiries. NLP—an interdisciplinary field bridging linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence—has emerged as a primary tool for automating and enhancing these interactions. Unlike rule-based systems that rely on static decision trees, NLP-driven interfaces can understand nuances in human language, detect sentiment, and adapt responses in real time.
Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have propelled chatbots and virtual assistants into mainstream service environments. From retail support to healthcare triage, NLP-based solutions provide end-to-end assistance, reduce average handling times, and maintain service continuity outside traditional business hours. Additionally, emotionally aware chatbots employ sentiment analysis to gauge user feelings, enabling more empathetic responses and reducing frustration. Automated workflows powered by NLP also aid in knowledge management and self-service portals, guiding customers through product catalogs, return policies, or troubleshooting steps without human intervention.
However, adopting NLP in customer service introduces multiple challenges. Maintaining conversational context can be difficult, especially during long or multi-turn exchanges. Ethical considerations also arise, including user privacy and algorithmic bias, particularly when models train on unfiltered or sensitive data. Furthermore, implementing NLP solutions at scale requires robust infrastructure and continuous model updates to ensure consistent service quality. Despite these hurdles, many organizations value NLP’s capacity to enhance user engagement, reduce operational costs, and improve overall responsiveness.
This review provides a systematic exploration of NLP-powered customer service solutions. It examines diverse approaches, such as emotional intelligence via advanced sentiment analysis, domain adaptation through knowledge graphs, and the evolution of chatbot platforms. By reviewing recent literature, this paper identifies emerging best practices and areas where methodological or ethical refinements are necessary. In doing so, the review highlights how NLP continues to streamline, personalize, and enrich customer interactions, positioning it as a critical technology for modern businesses. Finally, it presents future research directions on key areas like computational efficiency, trust-building mechanisms, and multilingual support.

These studies collectively emphasize improving user intent recognition and language parsing through advanced frameworks (1, 3, 9).
For instance, the Rasa DIET architecture offers enhanced sentiment analysis accuracy by tailoring trained classifiers to domain-specific nuances (3).
LangChain’s chunk screening approach, integrated with supervised learning, helps filter and organize large text corpora for more robust multi-turn conversations (9).
Examining LLMs like ChatGPT and Copilot reveals that metrics used for code synthesis can be adapted to assess general-purpose chatbot accuracy in customer-service interactions (1).

Key Findings:
• Rasa’s DIET architecture significantly boosts intent recognition and sentiment analysis (3).
• LangChain’s supervised chunk screening manages complex multi-turn dialogues more efficiently (9).

EmoLLMs are specialized for detecting nuanced emotional states, thereby enabling chatbots to respond empathetically even in high-frustration scenarios (8).
Communication style research demonstrates that polite, transparent, and apologetic language can mitigate user dissatisfaction following service failures (21).
Sustaining user trust over repeated interactions requires explanation-friendly approaches that attribute errors transparently and adapt response strategies accordingly (22).

Key Findings:
• Emotional intelligence layers in chatbots can elevate user satisfaction and perceived empathy (8).
• Adaptive, apologetic communication styles lead to higher trust and engagement after service mishaps (21).
• Explaining errors and attributing them clearly fosters longer-term trust retention (22).

Semi-human relationships emerge when chatbots mimic human communication, enabling deeper user engagement but raising concerns about over-anthropomorphizing AI systems (19).
Multi-turn toxic behaviors can proliferate in open-domain chatbots, necessitating continuous model retraining and robust detection frameworks for harmful or biased content (7).
Legal and ethical frameworks, especially around privacy and data handling, are paramount in large-scale implementations of public-facing chatbots (20).

Key Findings:
• Overly human-like chatbots can create ethical and emotional dilemmas regarding user expectations (19).
